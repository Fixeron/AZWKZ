<h3>NAME</h3>
ccguess - search for ccrypt encryption keys
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>
<pre>
<b>ccguess [<i>options</i>] <i>file</i>...</b>
</pre><p>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
The <b>ccguess</b> program attempts to guess <b>ccrypt</b>(1) encryption
keys by searching the relevant part of the key space. This is done by
prompting the user for an <i>approximate key</i> and then trying many
variations of this key. This is intended to assist <b>ccrypt</b> users
in recovering mistyped or forgotten keys, provided that they remember
at least part of the key.
<p>
Note that <b>ccrypt</b> provides strong cryptographic security: there
are no special back doors or shortcuts to recovering forgotten
keys. Therefore, the <b>ccguess</b> program does not have any special
powers. It simply works by trying different keys until a possible
match is found.
<p>
A search of the entire key space is not usually a practical option.
<b>ccguess</b> therefore works by prompting the user for an approximate
key. It then tries all variations that can be obtained by applying a
small number of changes. Here, each change is either a deletion of one
letter, an insertion of one letter, a replacement of one letter by
another, or a transposition of two adjacent letters. By default,
<b>ccguess</b> searches all keys that differ from the approximate key
by up to 5 changes. The number of changes searched can be adjusted
with the <b>--depth</b> option.
<p>
The mechanism by which <b>ccguess</b> determines whether a key is a
"possible match" is the same as that used by <b>ccrypt</b> to reject
non-matching decryption keys. There is a small chance of a false
match, i.e., <b>ccguess</b> may find a key that turns out not to be the
true encryption key and does not decrypt the file correctly. A false
match happens approximately once for every 4.3 billion keywords tried,
so the longer your search goes on, the higher the likelihood that a
false match is found. Normally, <b>ccguess</b> stops after the first
possible match is found, but the <b>-c</b> option can be used to search
for additional keys. The possibility of a false match can be
further reduced by supplying multiple files that have been encrypted
with the same key. In this case, <b>ccguess</b> will search for keys
that match <i>any</i> of the files, but will print a warning for keys
that do not match <i>all</i> of the files.
<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
<p>
The following options are supported:
<dl><dt><b>-h, --help</b><dd>
Help. Print usage information and exit.
<p><dt><b>-L, --license</b><dd>
Print license info and exit.
<p><dt><b>-V, --version</b><dd>
Print version info and exit.
<p><dt><b>-K <i>key</i>, --key <i>key</i></b><dd>
Specify the approximate key on the command line, rather than prompting
the user for it.
<p><dt><b>-d <i>n</i>, --depth <i>n</i></b><dd>
Search keys that contain up to <i>n</i> changes. The default is 5.
<p><dt><b>-c, --continue</b><dd>
Keep trying more keys even after the first match is found. By default,
<b>ccguess</b> will stop after the first key is found that matches all
input files.
<p><dt><b>-t <i>chars</i>, --chartable <i>chars</i></b><dd>
Specify the list of characters to try for replacements and
insertions. By default, <b>ccguess</b> will try all printable ASCII
characters. If you know, for example, that your key only used
lowercase letters and numbers, you can speed up the search by
specifying a list of characters explicitly. This option is mutually
exclusive with <b>-n</b>.
<p><dt><b>-n, --non-printable</b><dd>
Allow non-printable characters in keys. By default, <b>ccguess</b> will
only try printable ASCII characters. Note that the use of this option
slows down the search significantly. This option is mutually exclusive
with <b>-t</b>.
</dl>
<h3>ARGUMENTS</h3>
<p>
<dl><dt><!oops>
.I file
The name of a file that has been encrypted with the unknown key. This
file is only read from, not written to. The special filename "-" is
used to denote standard input.
<p>
If multiple files are specified, <b>ccguess</b> will search for keys
that match <i>any</i> of the files, but will print a warning for keys
that do not match <i>all</i> of the files.
</dl>
<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
<p>
Suppose the file <i>myfile.cpt</i> has been encrypted with the key
"gardenhouse", but the user remembers "gardenhose". The command
<pre>
<p>
   ccguess -K gardenhose myfile.cpt
<p>
</pre><p>
will find the correct key after 2318 guesses. 
<h3>EXIT STATUS</h3>
<p>
The exit status is 0 if at least one possible match is found, 1 if no
matches are found, and >=2 if an error occurred.
<h3>VERSION</h3>
<p>
